While creating this code I made the following assumptions: 

1. The database with all available products is already made so for the sake of this calculator, I created a static list 
of products that will be used by client of the application for verification purposes. The risk associate with this assumption 
is determining how th edatabase will identify each product that is considered a luxury item for taxing purposes. Another risk 
is visualizing how the application will complete error handling for empty orders. 

2. The directions stated that luxury items are taxed doubled in specific state, but it did not specify which states those were.
Due to the lack of clarification of those state, I assumed that none of the current clients were a part of those specific states.
The risk in this assumption is that one of the 5 current clients did indeed fall under that category and required extra logic to
be included in the logic for calculating their taxes and totals. 

3. I assumed that users of the application would either have access to or know someone who would have access to the code to change 
the variable for their client tax bracket in the event that the tax amount in their state should change. I have made it maintainable
by creating it as a global variable that can be easily found and updated as needed. The risk that this poses is if/when the tax rate 
in the area should change, the application would continue to tax customers at the previous tax rate until someone with proper 
authorization can change the rate on the backend of the application.
